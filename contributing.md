Contributing to the network Linux System Role
=============================================

Where to start
--------------

The first place to go is [Contribute](https://linux-system-roles.github.io/contribute.html).
This has all of the common information that all role developers need:

* Role structure and layout
* Development tools - How to run tests and checks
* Ansible recommended practices
* Basic git and github information
* How to create git commits and submit pull requests

**Bugs and needed implementations** are listed on
[Github Issues](https://github.com/linux-system-roles/network/issues).
Issues labeled with
[**help wanted**](https://github.com/linux-system-roles/network/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
are likely to be suitable for new contributors!

**Code** is managed on [Github](https://github.com/linux-system-roles/network), using
[Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

### Python Code

The Python code needs to be **compatible with the Python versions supported by
the role platform**.

For example, see [meta](https://github.com/linux-system-roles/network/blob/main/meta/main.yml)
for the platforms supported by the role.

If the role provides Ansible modules (code in `library/` or `module_utils/`) -
these run on the *managed* node, and typically[1] use the default system python:

* EL6 - python 2.6
* EL7 - python 2.7 or python 3.6 in some cases
* EL8 - python 3.6
* EL9 - python 3.9

If the role provides some other sort of Ansible plugin such as a filter, test,
etc. - these run on the *control* node and typically use whatever version of
python that Ansible uses, which in many cases is *not* the system python, and
may be a modularity release such as python311.

In general, it is a good idea to ensure the role python code works on all
versions of python supported by `tox-lsr` from py36 on, and on py27 if the role
supports EL7, and on py26 if the role supports EL6.[1]

[1] Advanced users may set
[ansible_python_interpreter](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/special_variables.html#term-ansible_python_interpreter)
to use a non-system python on the managed node, so it is a good idea to ensure
your code has broad python version compatibility, and do not assume your code
will only ever be run with the default system python.

Debugging network system role
-----------------------------

When using the `nm` provider, NetworkManager create a checkpoint and reverts the
changes on failures. This makes it hard to debug the error. To disable this, set
the Ansible variable `__network_debug_flags` to include the value
`disable-checkpoints`. Also tests clean up by default in case there are
failures. They should be tagged as `tests::cleanup` and can be skipped. To use
both, run the test playbooks like this:

```bash
ansible-playbook --skip-tags tests::cleanup \
    -e "__network_debug_flags=disable-checkpoints" \
    -i testhost, tests/playbooks/tests_802_1x.yml
```

### NetworkManager Documentation

[NM 1.0](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/#NM-1.0), it contains a full
explanation about the NetworkManager API.

### Integration tests with podman

1. Create `~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/containers/podman/` if this
  directory does not exist and `cd` into this directory.

    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/containers/podman/
    cd ~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/containers/podman/
    ```

2. Clone the collection plugins for Ansible-Podman into the current directory.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/containers/ansible-podman-collections.git .
    ```

3. Change directory into the `tests` subdirectory.

    ```bash
    cd ~/network/tests
    ```

4. Use podman with `-d` to run in the background (daemon). Use `c7` because
  `centos/systemd` is centos7.

    ```bash
    podman run --name lsr-ci-c7 --rm --privileged \
    -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro \
    -d registry.centos.org/centos/systemd
    ```

5. Use `podman unshare` first to run "podman mount" in root mode, use `-vi` to
  run ansible as inventory in verbose mode, use `-c podman` to use the podman
  connection plugin. NOTE: Some of the tests do not work with podman - see
  `.github/run_test.sh` for the list of tests that do not work.

    ```bash
    podman unshare
    ansible-playbook -vi lsr-ci-c7, -c podman tests_provider_nm.yml
    ```

6. NOTE that this leaves the container running in the background, to kill it:

    ```bash
    podman stop lsr-ci-c7
    podman rm lsr-ci-c7
    ```
