# workaround for: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/27973
# There is no way in Ansible to abort a playbook hosts with specific OS
# releases Therefore we include the playbook with the tests only if the hosts
# would support it.
# The test requires NetworkManager, therefore it cannot run on RHEL 6 or CentOS 6.
