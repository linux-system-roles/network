# workaround for: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/27973
# There is no way in Ansible to abort a playbook hosts with specific OS
# releases Therefore we include the playbook with the tests only if the hosts
# would support it.
# The test should run with NetworkManager, therefore it cannot run on
# RHEL/CentOS 6

    - ansible_distribution_major_version != '6'
    # NetworkManager 1.20.0 introduced ethtool settings support
    - NetworkManager_version.stdout is version('1.20.0', '>=')
