# Auto-update only listens to `push` events.
# If a pull request is already outdated when enabling auto-merge, manually
# click on the "Update branch" button a first time to avoid having to wait for
# another commit to land on the base branch for the pull request to be updated.
# on: push
# If pull requests are always based on the same branches, only triggering the
# workflow when these branches receive new commits will minimize the workflow
# execution.
